# VBA_Challenge_Public
This project analyzed stock market data for year 2022 in 4 different parts using VBA. The goal is to create a script that will loop through all the stocks for 3 months for each run and take the following information:

The ticker symbol.

Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given month to the closing price at the end of third month.

The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given month to the closing price at the end of quarter month.

The total stock volume of the stock.



You can find the script inside the VBAStocks folder of this repository. The script file is called Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.
